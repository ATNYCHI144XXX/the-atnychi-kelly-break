## Partnership-First Approach

This license represents a commitment to global financial integration and institutional adoption through a partnership model that prioritizes government and public institution success. We recognize that meaningful change in global financial systems requires institutions to have strong incentives and minimal barriers to implementation.

---

## Scope of Application

This license applies to:

1. **Financial Integration Systems** - Implementation of the SHAARK protocol, cryptographic systems, or related technologies in financial infrastructure
2. **Enforcement Systems** - Integration into regulatory compliance, law enforcement, or security systems
3. **Global Deployments** - Any deployment by government agencies, central banks, public institutions, or international organizations at municipal, regional, national, or international levels

---

## Terms & Conditions

### 1. Free Access & Implementation Rights

Government agencies, public institutions, and affiliated organizations are granted **free, perpetual, and irrevocable access** to:

- The ATNYCHI Kelly Break research and analysis
- SHAARK protocol specifications and reference implementations
- All associated documentation, research papers, and technical specifications
- Migration protocols and transition guidance

This includes the rights to:
- Implement the technology in production systems
- Modify and adapt the technology for institutional needs
- Deploy at any scale without licensing fees or upfront costs
- Integrate with existing infrastructure and systems

### 2. Revenue Sharing Framework

When implementations generate revenue, cost savings, or measurable economic value, the following revenue sharing split applies:

**75% to Government/Institution**  
**25% to Repository Owner (ATNYCHI144XXX)**

This split is calculated on:
- Direct revenue generated from systems utilizing this technology
- Quantifiable cost savings from implementation
- Economic value created through efficiency improvements
- Licensing or sublicensing revenue from third-party integrations

### 3. Rationale for Partnership Model

This 75/25 split is designed to:

- **Minimize Barriers to Adoption** - Institutions retain the majority of economic benefit, reducing financial risk and accelerating decision-making
- **Maximize Institutional Benefit** - The 75% share ensures governments and public institutions capture the lion's share of value created
- **Create Sustainable Partnership** - The 25% share provides ongoing support and development resources while maintaining institutional priority
- **Enable Global Financial Integration** - By prioritizing institutional success, we accelerate the global adoption necessary for systemic change
- **Align Incentives** - Both parties benefit from successful implementation, creating natural alignment for long-term collaboration
