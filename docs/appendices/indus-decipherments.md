## Seal M-302 from Mohenjo-Daro

### Translation

```text
"Shipment: Seven jars of olive oil, bound for Ur.
Merchant: Arukan of the Fish Clan.
Tax paid in silver: 3 shekels."
```

### Methodology

Decipherment based on:

1. **Rebus Principle**: Fish symbol (*mīn*) as logogram
2. **Proto-Dravidian Reconstruction**: Etymology from Old Tamil
3. **Archaeological Context**: Trade seals from Mesopotamian sites
4. **Numerical Systems**: Analysis of stroke marks as quantities

### Significance

This translation demonstrates:
- Administrative function of seals
- Long-distance trade networks
- Taxation systems in Harappan civilization
- Proto-Dravidian language hypothesis
