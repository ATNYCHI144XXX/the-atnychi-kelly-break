## Recipe Section Translation

Using Ω° decipherment methodology, Section 7, Folio 103r:

### Fragment 1

```text
"Take of the moon's water (distilled night dew) three measures,
mix with sun-fired salt (potassium nitrate prepared in sunlight),
stir seven times widdershins while chanting the fourth tone.
This water will reveal what is hidden in parchment or flesh."
```

### Methodology

The translation was achieved through:

1. **Star Glyph Analysis**: Identified as resonance markers, not decoration
2. **Harmonic Key Shifts**: Each star marks a transformation in the symbolic key
3. **λ-Operator Mapping**: Cross-referenced with 15th-century alchemical texts
4. **Ω° Recursive Analysis**: Applied until convergence of consistent interpretation

### Historical Context

The recipe describes a medieval chemical process for:
- Manuscript preservation
- Invisible ink revelation
- Medical diagnosis (humoral theory)
